Tarot Cards are a form of consumable you can obtain during a run. They can be acquired via Arcana Packs, Purple Seals, and the Shop.

Tarot Cards are used to modify various aspects of the playing cards in the deck, such as their suit or rank. They are also capable of giving cards Enhancements, giving them additional effects, such as giving extra chips or multiplier when scored. Some of them offer cash, generate new jokers or even create more consumables. There are 22 different cards available, and these unlock in your Collection when purchased or used in an unseeded run.

Usage notes

The Wheel of Fortune has a 12.5% chance of giving Foil, 8.75% chance for Holographic, and a 3.75% chance of Polychrome, which add up to 25% (or a 1/4 chance). The number of jokers you have that Wheel could apply to does not change the probability of it working. The Wheel will not apply to any Joker that already has an edition (including Negative). It also cannot be used if all Jokers already have an edition, and its Use button will be disabled.
The Hermit does nothing if you are below $0 (for example, with Credit Card, or The Tooth Blind.)
If Death is used on the automatically-selected card in the Cerulean Bell Boss Blind, the card converted will also stay permanently selected until played or discarded.
When using The World, The Sun, The Star or The Moon to convert cards, the rank and enhancements on the chosen cards remains unchanged.
Tarot, like other Jokers and Consumables, can't have duplicates in the shop or Booster Packs without Showman. If all 22 Tarots are available, subsequent Tarot spawned will always be Strength.
If a tarot card is in the shop, it cannot also be in that shop's pack. This means that rolling until a weak tarot card appears in the shop, and then opening a tarot pack, will result in a slightly stronger pack (as it cannot have the weak tarot that's still in the shop).

Trivia

All of the tarot cards in Balatro are based on the Major Arcana, which are trump cards from a 78-card pack of cards. They are also often used in tarot reading, a form of divination or fortune telling. Most of the tarot cards effects represent the meaning of the major arcana, although some of them are just simpler visual references.
One of The Tower's meanings when faced upright is "revelation," "chaos," or "awakening." When reversed, the card means "personal transformation" or "averting disaster." Both of these meanings refer to its ability to transform one card into a Stone Card, thus averting the disaster of not having the correct rank or suit for a certain hand.
Judgement, when faced upright, means "rebirth" and "inner calling;" this falls in line with the card's ability to create a random Joker card if you have room.
Faced upright, Death means feelings of "change/transformation/transition," which explains the card's ability to convert the left selected card into the selected card on the right.
Upright, The Lovers pertains to meanings of "harmony/relationships" and "values alignment," referencing the Wild Card's ability where the card can be used as any or every suit.
The Wheel of Fortune has straightforward meanings like "good luck" and "a turning point" when faced upright, as well as reversed meanings of "bad luck" and "resistance to change." Both of these sets of meanings refer to the chanceful application of the Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome effects to a random Joker, or rather a lack thereof.
The Devil's meanings are a bit trickier, but with the card itself referring to feelings of "attachment," "addition," and "restriction" when faced upright, all point to its abilities of giving $3 if the card is held in the hand by the end of the round.
The Hanged Man has meanings that correlate with the concepts of "surrender" and "letting go," emphasizing the card's ability to destroy up to 2 selected cards.
Temperance's ability to give the current sell values of all Jokers in your possession ties in with the card's upright meanings of "balance," "moderation," and "purpose."
With Justice, its upright meanings of "cause and effect" in addition to "law," as well as its reversed meaning of "unfairness" all play into the card's ability to convert a selected card into a Glass Card; the cause is the conversion, with the potential effect of the glass card being a 1/4 chance to shatter when scored.
Another effect of the glass card is by giving a X2 Mult when scored.
The Hermit tarot card relates to upright meanings of "introspection" and "inner guidance," with the ability to double your money (Max of $20) acting as that sense of guidance to help you in your run.
The Magician and its ability to convert 2 cards into Lucky Cards ties into the card's upright meanings of "manifestation," "power," and "resourcefulness" with the lucky cards' abilities to provide +20 Mult and $20.
It's reversed meanings of "untapped talents" and "poor planning" can tie into the lucky cards' chances of triggering the abilities.
Faced upright, The Chariot has positive meanings of "willpower," "action," and "determination." All of these meanings relate to its ability to convert a selected card into a Steel Card, with the latter's ability of X1.5 Mult if the card is held in your hand acting as the determination to get you closer to your goal.
Strength's upright meanings of "courage," "persuasion," and "influence" tie into its power to convert 2 selected cards into higher ranked cards.
The High Priestess has upright meanings of "sacred knowledge" and "the subconscious mind," which correlates with its ability to create 2 random Planet Cards.
Similarly, The Emperor has meanings of "establishment," "authority," and "structure" when facing upright, therefore acting as a counterfeit to The High Priestess in which the former creates 2 random Tarot Cards.
The Empress has upright meanings of "nurturing" as well as "abundance," which relate to its power of converting 2 cards into Mult Cards, which add +4 Mult to the multiplier.
When facing upright, The Fool refers to feelings of "spontaneity," "innocence," and "free spirits." On the flipside, it also has a reversed meaning of "risk-taking;" all of these qualities correlate with the idea of taking risks by duplicating the last used Tarot or Planet card in using this card.
The Hierophant and its ability to transform up to 2 selected cards into Bonus Cards directly ties into the tarot card's upright meanings of "spiritual wisdom" and "institutions," in addition to its reversed meanings of "freedom" and "challenging the status quo."
The suit changing Tarot Cards such as The Sun (Hearts), The Moon (Clubs), The Star (Diamonds), and The World (Spades) relate to their meanings of "positivity/vitality/warmth," "illusion/subconscious/intuition," "hope/faith/renewal," and "completion/integration/accomplishment" respectively.
The artworks seems to be based on the Rider–Waite tarot deck.
However, it seems to omit and change small elements such as removing the angel in The Lovers and making The Empress' scepter into a staff.
The cards Justice (VIII) and Strength (XI) are swapped, as this ordering is more standard for other tarot decks.
Even though The Soul is not a tarot card in and of itself, it can still be found in Arcana Packs on extremely rare occasions and is also stylized like a traditional tarot card.
