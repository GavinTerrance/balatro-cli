# Interest in Balatro

## Overview

In **Balatro**, interest is a mechanic that rewards players with extra money at the end of each round.  For every **$5** the player holds at the end of a round, they earn **$1** in interest, up to a cap of **$5** per round:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  This means savings above **$25** do not generate additional interest:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}, incentivizing players to save money only to a point.

## Interactions

Several cards, vouchers and decks modify how interest works:

- **To the Moon joker:** Grants an extra **$1** of interest for every **$5** held at the end of a round:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Seed Money** and **Money Tree vouchers:** Raise the cap on interest earnings to **$10** and **$20** respectively.  Money over **$50** with Seed Money or **$100** with Money Tree does not generate additional interest:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  Combining these vouchers with *To the Moon* can produce very large interest gains:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- **Economy jokers** and **gold cards:** These cards help players accumulate money and therefore earn more interest.  However, economy jokers that trigger after the round ends (e.g., **Golden Joker**, **Rocket**) do not contribute to that round’s interest, while gold cards and jokers that trigger before (e.g., **Reserved Parking**) do count towards interest:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
- **Green Deck:** This deck does not earn interest.  Instead, it generates money through leftover hands and discards, making Seed Money and Money Tree vouchers and the *To the Moon* joker largely ineffective:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
- **Yellow Deck:** Starts with an extra **$10**, allowing the player to earn **$2** of interest in the first round:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

## Maximum interest

The table below summarises the maximum total interest a player can earn per round when holding **one copy of *To the Moon*** under different voucher scenarios:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:

| Deck | Interest with no vouchers (holding $25) | Interest with **Seed Money** (holding $50) | Interest with **Seed Money + Money Tree** (holding $100) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Default** | **$5**:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} | **$10**:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} | **$20**:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} |
| **With To the Moon** | **$10**:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} | **$20**:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} | **$40**:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} |
| **Green Deck** | **$0**:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} | **$0**:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} | **$0**:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} |

The Default deck earns up to $20 interest per round when using both vouchers.  With *To the Moon*, players double their earnings: $10 interest with no vouchers, $20 with Seed Money and $40 with both vouchers:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.  The Green Deck cannot generate interest and always yields zero:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.
