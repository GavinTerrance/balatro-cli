Vouchers are items offered in the shop, and refresh or restock in the shop after the players first completed round, after defeating the boss blind of each ante, or by claiming the Voucher Tag and skipping a blind. Unlike consumable items, Vouchers and their effects are permanent and remain effective for the entirety of a run. There are 32 Vouchers in total.

The Vouchers are split into 16 pairs, each affecting a different aspect of gameplay. Within each pair is a weaker "initial" Voucher (costs $10) and a stronger "dependent" Voucher (costs an additional $10) that generally enhances the effect of the former. No Voucher can be claimed twice in a single run normally, and only by claiming an "initial" Voucher can the player then claim the "dependent" Voucher in future shops in the run. The chance for each Voucher to appear is the same, and the same Voucher can show up multiple times during a run if not purchased, and stays the same on restock. If the shop runs out of Vouchers, either due to excessive spawning from the Voucher skip Tag, or because all 32 Vouchers have been bought, only Blank Vouchers can show up.
