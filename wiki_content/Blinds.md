Blinds are the main obstacle that the player must overcome in Balatro. For each round, the player has to get enough score to beat the Blind, losing the game otherwise. Defeating the Blind may earn some reward money.

An Ante is made up of three Blinds in succession: a Small Blind, a Big Blind, and a random Boss Blind. Special Boss Blinds called Finisher Blinds only appear on the last level of a run, at Ante 8. The player can choose to take on a Small or Big Blind, or to skip one or both and claim one or more Tags instead; Boss Blinds must always be played.

The score required by a certain Blind is determined by the Ante level. Generally, you start at Ante 1 and go up a level for every Boss Blind defeated.

Blinds

Small Blind and Big Blind

Small and Big Blinds have no other effects and can be skipped to get a Tag. The score required is 1x base chips for Small Blind, and 1.5x base chips for Big Blind. On Red Stake or higher, Small Blinds will give no reward money.

Boss Blind

Boss Blinds are the last blind of an Ante, most of which require a score of 2x base chips. Boss Blinds have certain special effects that add difficulty to the round, for example:

Debuffing some category of cards. The debuffed cards, appearing with a red cross, can still make Poker Hands but won't be scored. Effects made by holding, scoring or discarding the card, from Card Modifiers or Jokers (with a few exceptions, such as Flower Pot) will also be deactivated. Debuffed Wild Cards will return to their base suit.
Causing some cards to be drawn face-down, making them entirely hidden before being played. A hand played including face-down cards will have its type displayed as "???"; scoring and other effects will still perform as normal. These face-down cards still sort correctly into rank or suit position when ordering your cards. They can also be briefly uncovered by using Tarot Cards to modify them (for example, The Empress).
Restricting the size or type of poker hand that can be played. Hands that don't meet the restriction can still be played, but will not be scored or activate other effects, acting like a discard.
Boss Blinds are randomly selected. Each Boss Blind has a minimum ante in which it can appear, with Ante 1 having only eight possible bosses. Boss Blinds cannot reappear in a run until all other blinds have appeared or been defeated once.

Boss Blinds cannot be skipped, but there are other ways to avoid them:

The vouchers Director's Cut and Retcon enable players to reroll Boss Blinds. Rerolling on Ante 8 (or a multiple of 8) will always roll a Finisher Blind, and other antes will always roll a normal Boss Blind.
Luchador and Chicot can disable the effect of Boss Blinds. For blinds with an extremely high score (The Wall and Violet Vessel), the score will return to normal (2x base chips).

Finisher Blind

Finisher Blinds are a special type of Boss Blind, that appear at the end of the game (Ante 8). In endless mode, Finisher Blinds will appear again in Ante 16, 24, and 32.

Apart from their timing, they are otherwise identical to regular Boss Blinds (can be rerolled, disabled by Chicot, and so on).

Antes

An Ante is made up of three Blinds. A run will always begin at Ante 1. After beating the Finisher Blind in Ante 8, the run is won, but the player can choose to continue in Endless Mode to set a personal high score. Endless Mode begins from Ante 9 and purports to offer infinite Ante levels to ascend, with additional Finisher Blinds every eight Antes, but Ante score requirements also scale much faster. Under Blinds in the Collection, a list of the base score per Ante is shown up to Ante 16, although the player can reach higher Antes. Ante 0 can be reached by purchasing a Hieroglyph on Ante 1 (or Petroglyph on Ante 1 to reach Ante 0 a second time). Ante -1 can be reached via incredibly rare circumstances, involving a voucher tag, very fast reflexes, and the seed to roll both vouchers. A basic demonstration can be found here.

Green Stake and Purple Stake (or higher) will cause chip requirements to be higher. Playing on the Plasma Deck doubles the Ante requirement for all stakes.

39 4.8e309 (overflows to naneinf) 9.6e309 (overflows to naneinf) 1.9e310 (overflows to naneinf)

In Ante 39, the score requirement exceeds 21024 (Approximately 180 uncentillion , or 18 million googol googol googol, exact value 179,769,313,486,231,590,772,930,519,078,902,473,361,797,697,894,230,657,273,430,081,157,732,675,805,500,963,132,708,477,322,407,536,021,120,113,879,871,393,357,658,789,768,814,416,622,492,847,430,639,474,124,377,767,893,424,865,485,276,302,219,601,246,094,119,453,082,952,085,005,768,838,150,682,342,462,881,473,913,110,540,827,237,163,350,510,684,586,298,239,947,245,938,479,716,304,835,356,329,624,224,137,216), which is the largest number that can be represented in double-precision floating point format, causing the score to overflow to nan (not a number). Scoring over 21024 points results as the score showing as naneinf (nan exponent infinity). Since nan is incomparable to any value, scoring even naneinf is not sufficient for beating a score requirement of nan (even with Mr. Bones), meaning that at the current moment, Ante 39 is the highest Ante reachable in Endless mode without the use of glitches to skip antes. A player is considered to have "completed" or "beaten" endless mode if one scores naneinf on Ante 39.

A calculator for the score requirements for antes can be found here.

Notes

When playing against The Pillar, which debuffs cards played previously in the ante, if a debuffed card is modified in any way (such as having its suit changed, or being made Gold by a Tarot card), the card will now be "different" and thus no longer be debuffed.
The scaling in Endless mode is faster than super-exponential, proportional to x x2 (polynomial-exponential), where x denotes the current Ante. The common Endless build of Mime/Baron with Perkeo/Cryptid and Red Seal Steel kings can, theoretically, scale at a similar or faster speed (proportional to x x2). However, this would involve the constant addition of (presumably negative) copies of Blueprint or Brainstorm to the joker roster every Ante, a near-impossible feat in a normal game, unless using extremely tedious tarot-based infinite money strategies. (You may use Mime/Baron with Burgular to get x^x^3 Perkeoless) Regardless, in vanilla Balatro, the Ante 39 nan overflow will always end the run, meaning there is never any need to go to such great lengths to scale a build.
When playing against The Hook discards 2 random cards, meaning that such jokers as Mail-In Rebate, Castle or Hit the Road will count the discarded cards. However, that also means that Green Joker and Ramen will count those discards as well.
When playing against Cerulean Bell and using Death to convert a card into the permanently selected card, the converted card also cannot be de-selected.
It is possible to reach Ante -1 by utilizing Yellow Deck and a Voucher skip tag. On a seed that has Hieroglyph in Ante 1, skip for the Voucher tag, beat Big Blind then cash out. With slow game speed (recommended 0.5 or 1), quickly buy Hieroglyph before the Voucher tag activates, which will allow Petroglyph to spawn since the game checks for voucher availability after Hieroglyph has been bought. With the bonus econ from Yellow Deck, it is possible to buy both Vouchers, which bring players to Ante -1.
There are 4 Jokers which can still be distinguished while face down due to their unique shape, being the Square Joker, Half Joker, Wee Joker and Photograph.

Trivia

The names Small Blind, Big Blind, and Ante are based on poker terminology.
The symbols and names of most of the Boss Blinds are based on the letters of the Phoenician alphabet. The sole exception is The Flint, which is an original creation by the developer, though it resembles the runic letter jera (ᛃ).
According to LocalThunk, the reason for inventing a new symbol for The Flint was to bring the total number of blinds from 29 to 30 for a neat Collection screen.
The symbols and names of the five Finisher Blinds are based on alternate playing card suits: Hearts, Bells (replaces Diamonds in German decks), Acorns (replaces Clubs in German decks), Leaves (replaces Spades in German decks), and Vessels (replaces Hearts in Italian and Spanish decks).
The Arm used to be able to de-level played Poker Hands to level 0. This was changed in 1.0.0k.
The name of every blind contains exactly two words each.
The name of every non-finisher boss blind starts with the word "The".
Balatro developer LocalThunk has given the reasoning behind the design of some boss blind effects in the Balatro Discord.
The Plant debuffs face cards because plants do not have faces.
The Needle requires precision in reference to the phrase "thread the needle".
The Wheel has a chance-based effect similarly to The Wheel of Fortune.
The Eye bans repeat hand types because it has observed what hands you've played.
